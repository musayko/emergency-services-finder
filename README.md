### **1. Project Description**

The "24/7 Emergency Services Finder" is a hyperlocal, curated directory designed to solve a critical problem: connecting individuals facing urgent household emergencies with verified, available local service providers outside of standard business hours.

Our goal is to create a simple, fast, and reliable platform that serves two primary users:
1.  **Seekers:** Users in distress who need to quickly find trustworthy 24/7 help (e.g., plumbers, electricians).
2.  **Providers:** Qualified service professionals who can receive valuable, targeted leads for emergency jobs.

The application will feature a clean search interface, detailed provider profiles, and a straightforward system for providers to manage their listings.
